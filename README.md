# Diverse Voices in Quality Engineering 

Diverse Voices is a curated list of blogs and publications focused on software quality and quality engineering, collaboratively maintained by the testing and quality engineering community. 

## Goal
This page aims to amplify and connect underrepresented voices in quality engineering and software testing by curating a comprehensive list of blogs and publications authored by historically marginalized professional genders in tech. By providing a centralized resource, we want to increase visibility, foster knowledge-sharing, and support career growth for diverse professionals in the field.
